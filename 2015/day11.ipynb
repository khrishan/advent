    "## --- Day 11: Corporate Policy ---\n",
    "\n",
    "Santa's previous password expired, and he needs help choosing a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help him remember his new password after the old one expires, Santa has devised a method of coming up with a password based on the previous one. Corporate policy dictates that passwords must be exactly eight lowercase letters (for security reasons), so he finds his new password by **incrementing** his old password string repeatedly until it is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incrementing is just like counting with numbers: `xx`,`xy`, `xz`, `ya`, `yb`, and so on. Increase the rightmost letter one step; if it was `z`, it wraps around to `a`, and repeat with the next letter to the left until one doesn't wrap around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately for Santa, a new Security-Elf recently started, and he has imposed some additional password requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Passwords must include one increasing straight of at least three letters, like `abc`, `bcd`, `cde`, and so on, up to `xyz`. They cannot skip letters; `abd` doesn't count.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Passwords may not contain the letters `i`, `o`, or `l`, as these letters can be mistaken for other characters and are therefore confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Passwords must contain at least two different, non-overlapping pairs of letters, like `aa`, `bb`, or `zz`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `hijklmmn` meets the first requirement (because it contains the straight `hij`) but fails the second requirement requirement (because it contains `i` and `l`).\n",
    "+ `abbceffg` meets the third requirement (because it repeats `bb` and `ff`) but fails the first requirement.\n",
    "+ `abbcegjk` fails the third requirement, because it only has one double letter (`bb`).\n",
    "+ The next password after `abcdefg`h is `abcdffaa`.\n",
    "+ The next password after `ghijklmn` is `ghjaabcc`, because you eventually skip all the passwords that start with `ghi`..., since `i` is not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given Santa's current password (your puzzle input), what should his **next password** be?"
