    "## --- Day 10: Elves Look, Elves Say ---\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, the Elves are playing a game called look-and-say. They take turns making sequences by reading aloud the previous sequence and using that reading as the next sequence. For example, `211` is read as \"one two, two ones\", which becomes `1221` (1 2, 2 1s).\n",
    "\n",
    "Look-and-say sequences are generated iteratively, using the previous value as input for the next step. For each step, take the previous value, and replace each run of digits (like `111`) with the number of digits (`3`) followed by the digit itself (`1`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ `1` becomes `11` (1 copy of digit 1).\n",
    "+ `11` becomes `21` (2 copies of digit 1).\n",
    "+ `21` becomes `1211` (one 2 followed by one 1).\n",
    "+ `1211` becomes `111221` (one 1, one 2, and two 1s).\n",
    "+ `111221` becomes `312211` (three 1s, two 2s, and one 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with the digits in your puzzle input, apply this process `40` times. What is the **length of the result**?"
