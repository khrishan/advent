    "A hash indicates the **next character** in the password if its **hexadecimal** representation starts with **five zeroes**. If it does, the sixth character in the hash is the next character of the password.\n",

    "\n",
    "+ The first index which produces a hash that starts with five zeroes is 3231929, which we find by hashing `abc3231929`; the sixth character of the hash, and thus the first character of the password, is `1`.\n",
    "+ `5017308` produces the next interesting hash, which starts with `000008f82...`, so the second character of the password is `8`.\n",
    "+ The third time a hash starts with five zeroes is for `abc5278568`, discovering the character `f`.\n",
